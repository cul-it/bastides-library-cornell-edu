<p>At one time many bastides had (and some retain) a special type of arched opening at the corners of the marketplace. This allowed carts, wagons, and animals direct access to the market square without disrupting foot and wheeled movement passing through the arcades along its sides.  This feature was called a <em>corniere</em>.  At some time in the past this word came to be applied in some bastides to the arcades themselves.</p>
<p>In other bastides the arched or post and beam enclosures along the sides of the marketplace are known as the <em>couverts</em>. Still other bastides use <em>cornieres</em>, <em>ambans</em>, or <em>arcades</em> to refer to this distinctive feature. Thus, a visitor seeking the marketplace in one town may find an arrow pointing to the <em>place des arcades</em>, while elsewhere finding direction signs leading to the <em>place des cornieres</em>, the <em>place des ambans</em> or the <em>places des arcades</em>.</p>
